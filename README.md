# :: 2dPerceptron ::
 a simple perceptron algorithm to differentiate between 2 sets of randomized, linearly separable data

Takes in two points (specified by the user as constants in perceptron.py), randomizes those points in a gaussian distribution, and then finds a line that separates the two data sets. 
 Once the algorithm has found the line, any point could then be placed in group 1 or group 2.

- to visualize the algorithm run perceptron.py 

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib

# :: 2dPerceptron ::
 a simple perceptron algorithm to differentiate between 2 sets of linearly separable data

 the pereceptron algorithm is one of the earliest and simplest examples of machine learning.
 In this algorithm, it takes in two points (specified by the user as constants in perceptron.py), randomizes those points in a gaussian manner, and then finds a line that separates the two data sets. 
 Once the algorithm has found the line, any point could then easily be shown to be in group 1 or group 2.

- to visualize the algorithm run perceptron.py 

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
